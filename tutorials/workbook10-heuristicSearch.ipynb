    "## Introduction\n",
    "This practical uses a simple easy-to-visualise optimisation problem to illustrate the properties of different search algorithms.\n",
    "The problem is this:\n",
    "- We are given  a model of a problem in terms of a graph  - which we can visualise as a maze.\n",
    "- We are given a starting position and the desired endpoint (goal)\n",
    "- The problem is to find a sequence of inputs that takes us from the start to the goal, preferably in as few moves as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims of this practical\n",
    "1. To give you the opportunity to demonstrate your underrstanding by implementing the code needed to create different search algorithms.\n",
    "2. To give you experience of comparing the behaviour of different search algorithms.\n",
    "3. To give you experience of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm for a problem ( in thid case path-planning) by creating different instances of a problem (mazes) to *stress-test* different methods. \n",
