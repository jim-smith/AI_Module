    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 2 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. The aim of this session is to give you practical experience of creating a  knowledge base for an expert system with some simple forward chaining.\n",
    "2. To do that you will author a simple chat-bot using the AIML knowledge representation language. \n",
    "3. To aid your learning, your chat-bot should hold your revision notes about the core concepts from the lectures so far, in the form of a 'FAQ'\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "- Made your first set of ten revision questions and answers.\n",
    "- Coded up your chatbot to answer those questions.\n",
    "- Successfully used  &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs in AIML to do some simple forward chaining for different greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your chatbot using &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs storing knowledge about language,   \n",
    "  so that your bot can respond to different ways of asking the same question\n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your bots with categories for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- Pandorabots (www.pandorabots.com) offers free sign-in and hosts a web-based interface for authoring bots.   \n",
    "   Once you start doing more complex things, the feedback on what is happening as your queries are processed  is a little better than the python aiml version.  \n",
    "   But some students have found the text preprocessing is  different to the 'official reference' version we use for the marking system.  \n",
    "   You might like to try developing your AIML in pandorabots then importing it into these jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Good places to look for help with AIML syntax are: \n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML-Fundaments](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-fundamentals)\n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",
    " - [The official AIML site](http://www.aiml.foundation/doc.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> <b>REMEMBER:</b> Because it is much more lightweight, in class we are using the python-aiml package. <br>This is only AIMLv1-compliant, and  does not support all the features of AIMLv2. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\"> <b>REMEMBER:</b> IF you are running the notebooks on the cloud server you need to click on the kernel menu and then change-kernel to'AIenv'.<br>\n",
    "IF you are running locally AND you created a virtual environment in Jupyter click on the kernel menu then change-kernel OR in VSCode use the kernel selector in the top-right hand corner.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to identify what knowledge we want our expert system chatbot to talk about.  \n",
    "You may as well use this as practice for making revision notes.  \n",
    "Look through the slides from the lecture so far and identify 10 facts or statements for your bot to answer.\n",
    " - for example you might choose _\"what do we mean by the cardinality of a relationship?\"_   \n",
    "   and want your bot to answer _\"cardinality is meta knowledge that tells us whether a relationship is one-one, many-to-one, etc.\"_\n",
