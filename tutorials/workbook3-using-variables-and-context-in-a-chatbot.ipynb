    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 3 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This session is split into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first activity is designed  to give you practical experience of using wildcards and `<that>` tags to embed long-term knowledge and context within your chatbot.  **You will need these skills to pass the coursework**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second activity gives you a chance to see the specification for the first bit of coursework: the questions your bot has to answer and the marking scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "- Successfully used the AIML constructs `*` `_`, `<srai>`, and `<star/>` tags to make general statements about language (how people ask questions).\n",
    "- Successfully used `<that>` tags to give let your bot respond in the context of a dialogue.\n",
    "- Understood what you need to do for the first piece of coursework.\n",
    "- Downloaded and run the marking programme to check you can test your knowledge-base before submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your revision chatbot so it can the same question asked in different ways about each of the facts you have stored.   \n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your revision bot with definitions and examples for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- Pandorabots (www.pandorabots.com) offers free sign-in and hosts a web-based interface for authoring bots.   \n",
    "   Once you start doing more complex things, the feedback on what is happening as your queries are processed  is a little better than the python aiml version.  \n",
    "   But some students have found the text preprocessing is  different to the 'official reference' version we use for the marking system.\n",
    "- Program-y is a fully featured AIML2-compliant python-based system with clients for twitter, etc. \n",
    "   You might like to try developing your AIML in pandorabots then importing it into these jupyter notebooks.\n",
