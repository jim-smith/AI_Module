    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 4 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This session is split into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first activity is designed  to give you practical experience of:\n",
    "- setting bot predicates outside your bot,  to customize it\n",
    "- using `<system>` tag-pairs to make calls and connecting your chatbot to external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second activity gives you a chance to work on the first bit of coursework, and make sure your testing toolchain is in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood how external programmes can affect your bot,  and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood what you need to do for the first piece of coursework.\n",
    "- Checked your toolchain for developing the coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your revision chatbot so it can the same question asked in different ways about each of the facts you have stored.   \n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your revision bot with definitions and examples for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- Pandorabots (www.pandorabots.com) offers free sign-in and hosts a web-based interface for authoring bots.   \n",
    "   Once you start doing more complex things, the feedback on what is happening as your queries are processed  is a little better than the python aiml version.  \n",
    "   But some students have found the text preprocessing is  different to the 'official reference' version we use for the marking system.\n",
    "- Program-y is a fully featured AIML2-compliant python-based system with clients for twitter, etc. \n",
    "   You might like to try developing your AIML in pandorabots then importing it into these jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Good places to look for help with AIML syntax are: \n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML-Fundaments](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-fundamentals)\n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",
    " - [The official AIML site](http://www.aiml.foundation/doc.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "** If you set up the coursework last week skip to the next cell**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have not already done so, create a new folder to store your first coursework code in.\n",
    "2. Go to the assessments folder on Blackboard, or the   <a href=\"https://github.com/jim-smith/AI_Module/tree/master/coursework\">Module Github Repository</a>\n",
    "and download these files into your coursework folder:\n",
    " - 1cat.aiml\n",
    " - AIML_Coursework_marker.ipynb\n",
    " - coursework-questions-and-responses.txt\n",
    " \n",
    "3. If you prefer,  you can download the 'bare' python file AIML_Coursework_marker.py instead of the jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "  The instructions below assume you are using the notebook,  but it should be self-evident if you prefer to use the python file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Make a copy of the file 1cat.aiml with the name \"student.aiml\".  \n",
    " - by default the marking code will load your coursework from \"student.aiml\".  \n",
    "   However, you will find instructions on how to change this within the notebook.\n",
    "5. Run the notebook to test your toolchain, noting that: \n",
    " - The marking system will tell you how many categories have been loaded, so you can check if your aiml file loaded as expected.\n",
    " - The file 1cat.aiml only has one category in and should score 1 mark.\n",
    " - There is a debug flag set to False.   Changing this to True will give you more feedback.\n",
    " - The marks and feedback you will get from the 'official' system are enclosed in xml tag-pairs ( &lt;SCORE&gt; and &lt;MESSAGE&gt; respectively).\n",
    " - The system creates a file student-results.txt which tells you question-by-question what the expected response was,  and what your bot responded.\n",
    " - **The marking system will randomise the question order every time** ( except the 3 questions that require context)\n",
