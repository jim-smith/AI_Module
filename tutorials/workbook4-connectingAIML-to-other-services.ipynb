    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 4 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This session is split into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first activity is designed  to give you practical experience of:\n",
    "- setting bot predicates outside your bot,  to customize it\n",
    "- using `<system>` tag-pairs to make calls and connecting your chatbot to external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second activity gives you a chance to work on the first bit of coursework, and make sure your testing toolchain is in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood how external programmes can affect your bot,  and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood what you need to do for the first piece of coursework.\n",
    "- Checked your toolchain for developing the coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your revision chatbot so it can the same question asked in different ways about each of the facts you have stored.   \n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your revision bot with definitions and examples for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- Pandorabots (www.pandorabots.com) offers free sign-in and hosts a web-based interface for authoring bots.   \n",
    "   Once you start doing more complex things, the feedback on what is happening as your queries are processed  is a little better than the python aiml version.  \n",
    "   But some students have found the text preprocessing is  different to the 'official reference' version we use for the marking system.\n",
    "- Program-y is a fully featured AIML2-compliant python-based system with clients for twitter, etc. \n",
    "   You might like to try developing your AIML in pandorabots then importing it into these jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Good places to look for help with AIML syntax are: \n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML-Fundaments](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-fundamentals)\n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",
    " - [The official AIML site](http://www.aiml.foundation/doc.html)\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> <b>REMEMBER:</b> Because it is much more lightweight, in class we are using the python-aiml package. <br>This is only AIMLv1-compliant, and  does not support all the features of AIMLv2. </div>\n",
