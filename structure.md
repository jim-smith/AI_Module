## Schedule
### Week 1
Lecture:
- types_of_problems.ipynb
- Symbolic-vs-Computational_AI.ipynb

Tutorials:
- module-intro.ipynb
- workbook1_a_trivial_chatbot.ipynb

### Week 2
Lecture:
- Knowledge_Representation_Rules_and_Facts.ipynb
- Knowledge_Representation_Meta Knowledge.ipynb
- AIML_an_example_KRL.ipynb

Tutorials:
- So I thought that perhaps  the new week 2 tutorial could be about ‘why we need AI”  and “what implications do different types of AI have” with  learning outcomes of :
- understanding the difference between  problems and problem instances (randomised TSP generator, random Mastermind puzzles)
- understanding the differences between problems t hat scale badly, and the scaleability of different algorithms (greedy constructive search for tSP is sub-polynomial), exhaustive search aint.

### Week 3
Lecture:
- Knowledge_Representation_Syntax_and_Semantics.ipynb
- Knowledge_Representation_Variables_and_Quantifiers.ipynb
- AIML_variables_and_branching.ipynb
- AIML_context.ipynb

Tutorials: Implementing concepts from week2's lecture in AIML
- workboook2-authoring-your-first-chatbot.ipynb

### Week 4
Lecture:
- Modern-expert-Systems.ipynb

Tutorials:
- workbook3-using-variables-and-context-in-a-chatbot.ipynb

### Week 5
Lecture:
-  Machine_Learning_Introduction_and_Types.ipynb

Tutorials:
- workbook4-conectingAIML-to-other-sertvices.ipynb
**this has to be run locally   we can't run a separate browser on the csctcloud server**
- Discussion about working on coursework, planning etc.
